## Kutez Case App ##
This is my implementation on the case given to me by kutez. This project consists of 2 main parts:
- A RESTful API running on backend. Developed using node.js and express.js . 
- A frontend interface developed using vite and react with tailwindcss.

### Issues ###
- Real time gold price data was retrieved using metalpriceapi.com API in the beginning but free version has limited requests. So financial reasons and not getting stuck there made me move on
- There are no emulator on my local machine, thus all changes done for mobile had been pushed to production. Not an issue since this is a mock application, wanted to mention.
- I tried using vercel to publish website but found render on my way. I figured out the problem is not with the service it is with the code but I was already doing what I need to do on render so I kept continuing there.
